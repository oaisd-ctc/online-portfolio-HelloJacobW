                    <h2>More about me!</h2>
                    <p>I have a scatterbrain personality that doesn't lie. I don't like sarcasm because its just lying blatantly. I like to say random questions for the sake of it. Not that I would purposefully butt into a conversation with them. I am a logical, energetic, generally intependent person. I have a both quick and slow learning process where once I get the base of a subject learning progressively gets way easer. I love to try things in new ways and get creative with the stuff I know. I didn't get to this point using AI. I think its cool but not for me. I can go far with the things I know. And with my knowledge ever expanding I hope to go places. I have a work ethic where if I start something I will finish it, unless I get prioritized to start something else and forget about it for a minute. All in all I get things done. Another thing about me, I do not stop trying to get better at something I like. Unfortunately this leaves me on my own skill levels for some of the games I want to play with my friends, they don't want to verse me when I get good. Biking is a good example of this. I biked for about 3 years now to highschool and back, I have a lot of stories from them. But the thing I can do now is bike with no hands everywhere, and I keep stressing it and getting better. Im now able to take two 90 degree turns up a curvy hill after coming from a road, or bike up a giant hill with no hands. I can chat forever about random stuff. I get off topic easily with my ADHD. I love jokes. I love adventure and forests. Foxes are my favorite animal, Navy Blue and Orange are my favorite colors, they do not go together though. I have an addiction to youtube that I am remedying constantly now, but I'm staying away from all drugs including coffee. I need to end this somehow so Ill just end it with this, You cant live freely without being able to laugh at yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                        <p>Land a job for IT. Learn how to fix machines and help people. Whilst being able to code and enjoy myself. I plan to have a big hobby of creating a video game. Just one is on the bucket list but I have another game idea too. I hope to bring to life my childhood imagination with my first game in a all so familiar platform fighter. Maybe I could get a job at home helping a studio create games so I can stay with my house and potential family. Or maybe I can go out and just be a repair guy. Another goal I have is to own a fox at one point of my life. I've always liked them and now the plan is to get one after retirement and give it a good life. Maybe get better at my art, I can draw a really good sitting down dog but not one standing up. I can do so much, maybe win a major in my game, get a magic deck to play with people at Hi-5. So many things</p>
